### Changed name from vpm to vbm

### Added slim (termux) version

# vbm - An XBPS package management helper for vb-linux and VoidLinux
version 1.4.1

`vbm` is a simple to use, daily-driver enhancement to the awesome XBPS (X Binary
Package System), initially designed as a helper tool for use with VoidLinux.
Feel free to think "Void Package Management" or something if it helps you
remember its name, but please note that it's NOT a "package manager" in the
nitpickers understanding of the word - especially vbm shouldn't be confused with
XBPS - vbm is just an addon helper tool for XBPS to make your life easier.
That's it.

# Motivation to write vbm

I initially found XBPS to have a steep learning-curve, so I wanted to ease the
life of new VoidLinux users, and XBPS users in general. Please don't feel afraid
to look up the corresponding XBPS commands it translates to, or use vbm
--show-translations so you even see the translations already when using vbm
help. It has been said that vbm will ease the transition from Debian's APT, and
some other user-friendly repository/package-managers.

# Dependencies

vbm requires BASH, the Bourne Again SHell, which should be installed by default
on a new VoidLinux system. You also will need git and xcheckrestart both provided
by xtools package to obtain a clone of the vbm GitHub repository.
(see "Installation" section, below).

Or you can just grab vbm and paste it anywhere in your system.

# Installation


### (optional - needed for for xcheckrestart functions)

### Install xtools via `xbps-install`

    $ xbps-install -S xtools    

### 1. Clone vbm repository

    $ git clone https://codeberg.org/oSoWoSo/vbm.git

### 3. Enter the cloned repo and choose _vbm or _vbm_slim

    $ cd _vbm (or _vbm_slim)
    $ chmod +x vbm
    $ sudo make install

### 3a. Remove vbm

If you want to remove vbm, just use make to remove it. Make sure you are in the cloned directory first, then run:

    $ sudo make uninstall

    or simply

    $ vbm remove vbm :)

# ZOMG! PONIES!!111

Rainbows and unicorns, indeed. If you like colorized output, please see the
--color=true option, too! All vbm options try to have human readable and easy to
remember syntax, no --long-option-with-multiple-complex-words, no need to even
prefix arguments with --, vbm just tries to do its best it can to understand the
user (there are some command-line-switches, though, see vbm help).

Also vbm will ask for password if needed.
